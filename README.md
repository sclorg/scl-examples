Software Collections examples
=============================

Software Collections (SCL) are an RPM-based technology that gives you the power
to build, install, and use multiple versions of software on the same system,
without affecting system-wide installed packages.

This repository includes a set of RPM spec files that follow the best practices
for creating Software Collections.

This repo currently includes:
  * foo/ -- an SCL providing a CLI application and a daemon
  * bar/ -- an SCL extending the foo1 collection and providing a CLI application
  that uses the foo collection

For building and using the example collections, see README.md in particular
directory.
